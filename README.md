# SecureSensorNet-A-Multi-RPi-Motion-Environment-Monitoring-System

SecureSensorNet is a distributed multi-sensor monitoring system built using Raspberry Pi devices, designed for secure and coordinated data collection at the edge. Each Raspberry Pi node is equipped with different sensors (PIR motion, temperature/humidity, camera) and communicates securely over MQTT using TLS 1.3 encryption.

This system supports:

Real-time environmental sensing (temperature, humidity, motion)

Motion-triggered video recording and coordination across nodes

Secure MQTT communication using custom TLS certificates

Structured data publishing in JSON format

Centralized logging and CSV/JSON storage for ML-ready datasets

The project demonstrates a scalable and intelligent IoT edge solution suitable for smart environments, surveillance systems, or anomaly detection research.
